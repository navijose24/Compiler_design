A collection of Compiler Design Lab programs implemented in C. Includes lexical analyzer, parser, operator precedence parsing, symbol table construction, intermediate code generation, and more — with clean code, test cases, and outputs for easy reference.


About

These programs demonstrate the core concepts of compiler design, starting from lexical analysis to intermediate code generation.
They are intended to help students understand how different compiler components work internally.
